# TalkingAdventures
From my archives, TalkingAdventures (working title) is a prototype adaptation of Frotz.NET for Windows Phone by Szurgot Development to support hands-free &amp; eyes-free gameplay using Speech Synthesis and Speech Recognition. Frotz lets you take your old-school text adventures with you on the go with this port of Frotz. Supports all versions of the z-code files with the exception of V6. My goal is to eventually port this to Windows 10 / UWP.

## About Frotz
[Frotz](http://frotz.sourceforge.net/) is an interpreter for Infocom games and other Z-machine games. It complies with standard 1.0 of Graham Nelson's specification. It was written by Stefan Jokisch in 1995-1997. It was ported to Unix by Galen Hazelwood. Currently the Unix port is being developed and maintained by David Griffith. The Unix port is also the canonical core version upon which all other ports are based.
For more information about Frotz, see http://frotz.sourceforge.net/.
